    "message": "If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present./Madness, as you know, is a lot like gravity, all it takes is a little push./The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently./Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once./There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in its proportions./Children are fantastic little creatures, because next to drunk people, they are the only truly honest people on earth./I begin with an idea, and then it becomes something else./Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind./You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you./An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail./Antisocial behavior is a trait of intelligence in a world of conformists./What you do today can improve all your tomorrows./A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others./Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going./If you can dream it, you can do it./You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do."
